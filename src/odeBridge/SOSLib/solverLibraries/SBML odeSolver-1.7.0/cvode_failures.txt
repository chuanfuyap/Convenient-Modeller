Please, consult p. 49 ff. of the CVODE User Guide to learn about 
the CVode failures.
Here only some short information, taken from there, and personal 
experiences with the SBML_odeSolver are given.

0	SUCCESS:
	CVode completed integration with no errors.
-1	CVODE_NO_MEM:
	The cvode_mem argument passed to CVode was null.
	Should not happen in SBML_odeSolver. 
-2	ILL_INPUT:
	One of the inputs to CVode was illegal, including the 
	situation when one of the error vectors becomes < 0 
	during CVode's internal time stepping. The printed
	error message will give specific information.
	In SBML_odeSolver, this failure occurs when e.g. 
	the outtime passed with --time is `0'. 
-3 	TOO_MUCH_WORK:
	The solver took MXSTEP internal steps but could not
	reach outtime. MXSTEP is an argument of the iopt
	input array passed to CVode. 
	In the SBML_odeSolver it is set to 100000, which is 
	quite high.
-4	TOO_MUCH_ACC:
	The solver could not satisfy the accuracy demanded by 
	SBML_odeSolver (i.e. can currently not be set by the user)
	for some internal step. Has so far never occured with the
	SBML_odeSolver.
-5	ERR_FAILURE:
	Error test failures occured too many times during one internal
	time step or occured with |h| = hmin.
	Has so far never occured with the SBML_odeSolver.
-6 	CONV_FAILURE:
	Convergence test failures occurred too many times 
	(= MXMCF = 10) during one internal time step or occured with 
	|h| = hmin. 
	This can sometimes happen with or without use of the
	automatically generated Jacobian matrix. For that case
	the odeSolver tries to integrate again, but now without or
	with use of the Jacobian matrix, i.e. resetting the option
	'-j'. 
	In other cases this error can be avoided if allowing a bigger
	error tolerance with command line option '--error'; default
	is 1e-18.
-7	SETUP_FAILURE:
	The linear solver's setup routine failed in an unrecoverable 
	manner. Has so far never occured with the SBML_odeSolver.
-8	SOLVE_FAILURE:
        The linear solver's solve routine failed in an unrecoverable
	manner. Has so far never occured with the SBML_odeSolver.
