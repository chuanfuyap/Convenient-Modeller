Hi!

There were some difficulties with Solaris 9 and odeSolver 1.6.0. Here is 
a summary how I got it done. Maybe this helps you.


sbmlsolver> gunzip  SBML_odeSolver-1.6.0.tar.gz
sbmlsolver> tar -xvvf SBML_odeSolver-1.6.0.tar

Change into configure, line 4192 (only this line because the following 
configuration doesn't use the other lines including the -rpath switch):
Original line 4192:
SBML_RPATH="-Wl,-rpath,$with_libsbml/lib"
Modified line:
SBML_RPATH="-Wl,-R,$with_libsbml/lib"

sbmlsolver/SBML_odeSolver-1.6.0> ./configure 
--prefix=/home/u2/univ2/ttkk/tomaho/sbmlsolver/local_installation \
--with-libsbml=/home/u2/univ2/ttkk/tomaho/libsbml/local_installation \
--with-sundials=/home/u2/univ2/ttkk/tomaho/sundials/sundials

...
Build Settings for SBML_odeSolver v1.6.0:
----------------------------------
  host type            = solaris
  shared lib extension = so
  install dir          = 
/home/u2/univ2/ttkk/tomaho/sbmlsolver/local_installation
  CC                   = gcc
  CFLAGS               =
  LDFLAGS              =
  LIBS                 = -lm
  SBML Library         = yes
       CFLAGS          = 
-I/home/u2/univ2/ttkk/tomaho/libsbml/local_installation/include
-I/home/u2/univ2/ttkk/tomaho/libsbml/local_installation/include/sbml
       LDFLAGS         = 
-L/home/u2/univ2/ttkk/tomaho/libsbml/local_installation/lib
       LIBS            = -lsbml
SUNDIALS Library         = yes
       CFLAGS          = 
-I/home/u2/univ2/ttkk/tomaho/sundials/sundials/include
       LDFLAGS         = -L/home/u2/univ2/ttkk/tomaho/sundials/sundials/lib
       LIBS            = -lsundials_kinsol -lsundials_cvodes 
-lsundials_cvode -lsundials_nvecserial -lsundials_shared
  GRACE                = no
XMGRACE functionality will NOT be installed!
  GRAPHVIZ             = no
GRAPHVIZ functionality will NOT be installed!


sbmlsolver/SBML_odeSolver-1.6.0> make
...
options.c:7:20: getopt.h: No such file or directory
...

getopt has problems with portability. See e.g. 
http://www.thedotin.net/maillists/coldsync-hackers/msg01314.html

Download the needed getopt files, e.g. from 
http://www.molpopgen.org/krthornt/gccSolaris/
Compile them
sbmlsolver/SBML_odeSolver-1.6.0/odeSolver> gcc --pedantic -c getopt.c
sbmlsolver/SBML_odeSolver-1.6.0/odeSolver> gcc --pedantic -c getopt1.c

Add the object files to the linking by modifying
odeSolver/Makefile and odeSolver/Makefile.in:
The following 2 lines exist in both of these files. The third line is 
added (and the slash in the 2nd line).
am_odeSolver_OBJECTS = main.$(OBJEXT) commandLine.$(OBJEXT) \
        options.$(OBJEXT) printModel.$(OBJEXT) interactive.$(OBJEXT) \
        getopt1.$(OBJEXT) getopt.$(OBJEXT)

sbmlsolver/SBML_odeSolver-1.6.0> make

sbmlsolver/SBML_odeSolver-1.6.0> make install

... and the system is running. :-)

Best regards,
Tommi
