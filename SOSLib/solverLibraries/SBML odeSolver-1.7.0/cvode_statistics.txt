The SBML_odeSolver prints some statistics from CVode's integration
procedure after a finished integration. Please consult the 
CVODE User Guide for more detailed information. Here is some
short information on the printed statistics, as taken from p. 52 f.
of the User Guide.

nst	cumulative number of internal steps taken by
	the solver. 
nfe	number of calls to the ODE evaluation function `f'
nsetups	numver of calls to the linear solver's setup routine	
nje	numver of Jacobian evalutions, i.e. either calls to the 
	function that evaluates the automatically generated
	Jacobian matrix expressions or the internal approximation
	CVDenseDQJac.
nni 	number of NEWTON iterations performed.
ncfn	number of nonlinear convergence failures that have occured.
netf	number of local error test failures that have occured.
